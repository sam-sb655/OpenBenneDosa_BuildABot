# 3D Scanner: An Innovative Approach to Object Scanning [OpenBenneDosa]

## Overview

This repository includes the design, Arduino, and Python code for a low-cost 3D scanner developed by **Open Benne Dosa** for the **Build-A-Bot Buildathon** at the **Parsec 5.0 event**. Using affordable components like **Arduino Uno**, **VL53L0X sensors**, and **stepper motors**, the system efficiently captures 3D models with high precision. The unique vertical scanning algorithm ensures accurate height measurement and minimizes errors in data collection.
